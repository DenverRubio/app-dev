# My Favorite Movies/Series

**The Walking Dead _(Series)_**
_This series taught me how to correctly love, hate, and grieve a character in life & death_

**Everything Everywhere All At Once _(Movie)_**
_This movie was a rolercoaster ride of understanding emotions, mainly absudism, nhialism, and love_

**RuPaul's Drag Race Franchise _(Series)_**
_The only reality tv franchise I tolerate solely for its queer agenda & representation_

**Adventure Time _(Series)_**
_The only cartoon franchise I wish never ended soely for its character's depth & humaness_

**Big Hero 6 _(Movie)_**
_Soely because I uninentionally memorized most of the dialogue for some reason on my first watch_
